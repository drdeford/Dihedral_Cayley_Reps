# Dihedral_Cayley_Reps
MatLab code for computing eigenvalues for representations of D_n (and associated Cayley graphs).

Code contains MatLab scripts for computing the representations and their eigenvalues. Any of the functions with wheels in their name generate animations of the eigenvalue plots as n grows. Functions prepended with Cayley compute eigenvalues for Cayley graphs with specified generators. 

Figures contains some plots of the eigenvalues and matrices themselves.
